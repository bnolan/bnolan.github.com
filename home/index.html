              Hi! I'm Ben, and this is my girlfriend Rissa (and our cat Alfie). We are both proud Wellingtonians and are looking
              for our first home. We have been saving up a deposit and have got ourselves approved for a mortgage,
              but we haven't yet found the house to become our new home.
            </p>
            
            <h5>What we are looking for</h5>
            
            <p>
              An entry-level <b>house</b> with a little garden, located in the 
              suburbs of <b>Newtown</b> or <b>Berhampore</b>. In a perfect world we'd get a little cottage
              that was sunny in the afternoons and had a bit of character, but we're pretty realistic and
              would be happy to look at anything that fits our suburb choices.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              If your house sounds like it might fit the bill, give me a ring on <b>021 770 662</b>, or email
              <a href="mailto:bnolan@gmail.com">bnolan@gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Why you should sell to us</h5>
            
            <p>
              Well, there's no particular reason why you should choose to sell your house to Rissa and I. If
              you don't already have a real estate agent, you might save some money by selling to us
              directly. We're mostly hoping that someone
              with a nice little house sees this page and would give us the opportunity to make an offer on their
              house before they put it up for tender through an estate agent.
            </p>

            <h5>Why don't we buy through an agent?</h5>
              
            <p>
              Real estate agents are lovely professional people. The only
              bummer with buying a house through a real estate agent is that most of the properties 
              in our price range go for tender, instead of being sold by negotiation. It's hard to
              work out how much to offer in a tender process, since there is no negotiation back and
              forth, you instead have to guess a value and hope that you offered the most compelling
              offer. If you are a real estate agent and you have a property that's for sale by
              negotiation that you think we should look at - then we'd love to hear from you!
            </p>
