<p>I just went on a big skate of melbourne CBD.</p>

<p>I started at home (n√§he Southern Cross Station), then skated out to Prudence in West Melbourne. Prudence is a highly recommended bar. The beer is expensive, but the cocktails apparently are affordable. From Souther Cross to Prudence is mostly uphill, which meant that after a few beers, a few conversations and a good laugh - it was all downhill to Section 8.</p>

<p>Section 8 is a very cool bar. During the day. I went there in the evening and wasn&#8217;t so impressed. The skate was good though - it&#8217;s mostly downhill from Prudence along Victoria Street - then turn right, drop down into town (it&#8217;s a pretty steep skate through traffic down to little collins street) - and a hard left into Section 8.</p>

<p>S8 only had one beer I wanted - and it was in what australians call a &#8220;tallie&#8221; (800ml beer). I took a few drinks - decided S8 wasn&#8217;t for me, then stashed the beer in my back pocket and headed through town. There were people everywhere (and you can&#8217;t drink in public anywhere in Australia) so it took 5/10 minutes before I got out of the city (skating past the Melbourne Cricket Ground by now) and could drink the rest of my beer. It was a lovely long skate past the MCG - down a shallow smooth slope on a path surrounded in trees and grass. Had some good tunes on - nice times.</p>

<p>Then I bombed from the MCG down to Richmond - eyeballed out the gig I was going to go see at the corner bar, decided it wasn&#8217;t worth $50 to go see - then caught a tram back to Southern Cross and mellowed along Spencer street to home.</p>

<p>Melbourne. Good for skating.</p>
