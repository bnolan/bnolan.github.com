tedthedog: My anaconda don't want none unless you have a high likelihood of producing healthy offspring with a minimal chance of genetic disabilities, (edit) hun.
genericusername123: My homeboys tried to warn me, but that butt you got makes me so confident of your current well-being and future child-rearing potential

stupiddogcoffee: Baby got child rearing hips and a healthy store of body fat that can be used to nourish the developing offspring if food is scarce!
synthono: A lot of simps won't like this song, 'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it, And I'd rather stay and play, to ensure that my offspring develop properly and survive to continue my genetic line.
amarequester: She can do side bends or sit-ups to promote a healthy lifestyle and shed unwanted pounds after child birth. Please ask politely (but firmly) that she not work out so much on her glutes.
