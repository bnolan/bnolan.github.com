title: Brunch
---

I've stopped developing capt, my javascript build tool. I'm instead contributing to [brunch](http://brunchwithcoffee.com/), a tool built by Jan and Thomas. It's still early stages, but it is already ahead of where capt was. My todo list for brunch is:

 * Add jasmine testing to clients
 * Port static html generation templates from capt
 * Add code generation for classes / models

It's an interesting project, hopefully a good alternative to the upcoming framework from @sstephenson.
