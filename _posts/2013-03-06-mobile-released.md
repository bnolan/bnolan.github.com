I released the first iteration of a mobile site for ZoomIn last night. Try it out on your iphone or android phone and you should get a mobile-designed stylesheet. It's not complete, the recent / popular and group pages in particular aren't done very well, and I want to add a view that shows you 'what is nearby' (using the html5 geolocation api), but it's a first cut, and the place pages in particular are a lot more usable on mobile than they were before. I haven't tested it thoroughly on iphone yet (I don't have the simulator installed on my home laptop), but I'll probably be doing more mobile work over the coming week, so things will slowly improve.
