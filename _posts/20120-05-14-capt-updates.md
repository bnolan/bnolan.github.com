title: Capt updates
---

Did some quick [capt](/capt/) updates today. I bumped the version of jQuery, Backbone and Underscore. I fixed some bugs that new users would have found with a missing `/app/templates/` folder, and I (finally) got around to renaming controllers to routers. My next task with capt is to write some specs for it, and write some more examples to show how to use it.
