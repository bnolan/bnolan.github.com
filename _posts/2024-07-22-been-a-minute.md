In Top Gun, Maverick - Pete Mitchell, the eponymous Tom Cruise character, climbs into a stolen F14 and has to quickly familiarise himself with the controls so he can escape the unnamed enemy and get back to the boat.

Trying to work out how to drive the jekyll static site generator 7 years later feels similarily confusing. I gave up getting it to run on the macos beta I'm running and will probably port to a node.js static site generator in a few weeks.

So - since I posted on this blog last - I:

- Started a company of 30 people
- Made enough money to retire (yay!)
- Bought a building, a house, a lamborghini, a ferrari, a porsche, a tesla and a plane
- Downsized back down to 2 people
- Had a breakdown
- Sold the porsche and the ferrari

It's been a trip man, I'll try and break it down.

## Company

I started voxels.com in 2018. It's a blocky metaverse running on the ethereum blockchain. I built it using webgl. A creative metaverse that runs on people paying for land and not on selling their data or addicting people to cheap in-app upgrades is something I've wanted to build for years, so I've been really enjoying it.

I did it by myself or a year or two, then hired two friends, then in 2020, metaverses and digital art became massive so we hired and hired and hired until we had 30 people. Then Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company to meta, and I saw there was going to be a huge crash due to the influx of people into the scene. So we sold as much inventory as we can to get through the coming winter.

That winter has lasted 3 years now and shows no sign of ending. I started reducing the team in January of 2022 and got back down to 2 of us in 2024. I work with a good friend and I really enjoy working on the company. I lost a lot of money because I didn't shrink the company fast enough and there were some people that were hard to get rid of, but we're still in the situation where we can work on voxels for a long time.

## Made money

I spent my entire working career (since I bought an autocar magazine reviewing the then-new Porsche GT2) wanting to be a millionaire, and then watching acquantances making fortunes (Shane Cole at Paradise, Sam Morgan at Trade me, Rod Drury at Xero), so it was great to make that first million in 2020. I sat there refreshing the work bank account feverishly, my wife at my side, as the payment came through that ticked over from 995,000 to 1,000,050. It was an insane feeling.

## Bought a bunch of stuff

I met Koz a while after we'd both made done well from our companies, and he called it 'clocking capitalism'. I was very confused about the weird hollow feeling. I had always wanted a ferrari and a big house. And I got them both and I fely weirdly unsatisfied. I then thought maybe I just hadn't bought enough stuff, so I bought a bunch more things, and it didn't fill the hole.

To give some context, the 4 cars and the 2 planes cost less than a brand new Porsche Taycan:

- The lamborghini gallardo was crashed and written off, it has taken 2 years to find the parts to get it repaired.
- The ferrari 360 had no engine and i was having it converted to electric before I cancelled that project.
- The porsche was a beautiful 1997 boxster that I was converting to electric myself before I shelved that project so I can focus on voxels.
- The plane is a cessna skycatcher and came with a parts plane (MARV!) that I consider my 'second plane'
- My old-ass tesla model x was a really good buy, and because I turn a spanner on it myself I've kept the maintenance bills pretty low

### Downsized

I spent the sunday before I fired everyone throwing up on the couch. I cut really deep and early, so people could get good new jobs before the world realised we were heading for really hard economic times. The people that I terminated later on struggled to find good roles, so I'm glad I cut as early as I did. Many people saw this recession coming, I was glad I had the presence of mind to prepare the company and the team as early as I could.

### Had a breakdown

My friend Tom killed himself in 2023. I had been trying to help him with his mental health for a while, the last time I saw him we had a long talk under a pohutukawa tree on the south coast.

It was pretty clear to me he was going to try and end his own life, he had a genius-level IQ and you can't stop people like that, so I asked him to just call me first. I spoke with his support network a few minutes later and related what he'd said and they confirmed that he was under close watch.

A few months later he ended his life and I found out by group text. I had 5 missed calls on my phone that day.

## Started selling things

I spent 2023 and 2024 adrift, mostly alone, rattling around empty houses, going from house to house, finding I hadn't left any food in the pantry, or the refrigerator had food that expired weeks ago. I had some support at critical moments from old friends, and had some relationships that really helped me.

Lots of long walks, a friendly dog, some great music, lots of rest and reflection, and I started to get back on my feet a few months ago.

At this point I started selling as much as I could to make my life simpler. I sold the ferrari project and bought an old massey ferguson tractor. I traded the porsche on an electric van. I put my house up for sale and moved to a smaller place. I used my van to do some epic dump runs, throwing out hundreds of kilograms of rubbish, boxes, unfinished projects, equipment that we never used and was worthless now.

And I started learning to fly.
