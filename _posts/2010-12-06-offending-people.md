Any time you click a broken link (like this one for the [october update](https://joindiaspora.com/2010/10/29/october-update.html)) on the [Diaspora](http://www.joindiaspora.com/) site, you get this guy staring back at you.

Except, well I didn't do anything wrong, except I clicked a link that you broke on your site. And now I feel like a fool.

Cool graphic design. Really bad user experience.
