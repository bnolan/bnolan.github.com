title: Branch auto deployment
---

Here's a good idea. If you worked at a medium sized consumer start-up (say Flickr before yahoo bought them), it'd be awesome that if everytime you created a git branch - your CI system automatically created a subdomain for that branch and deployed your code there.

So for example - you run:

    git branch new-map-style
    git commit -a -m "all the commits"
    git push
    
Assuming your specs pass in CI, your CI server would create:

    http://new-map-style.staging.yourapp.com/
    
And deploy your branch there. So that you could post a link to your company message room and say "hey check out my new feature".
