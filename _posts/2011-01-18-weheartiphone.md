I got inspired by the design of [plaintext](http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/plaintext-dropbox-text-editing/id391254385?mt=8) and redesigned my phonegap app. Weheartplaces is an app for bookmarking places and accessing them on the go. It syncs with your facebook account so that in the future you'll be able to see your friends bookmarks and send bookmarks to friends.
