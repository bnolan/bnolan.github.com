title: My 10k apart submission
---

I haven't had much time to look at the Facebook Places API, but I have been working on my [10k apart](http://10k.aneventapart.com/) submission. This competition challenges you to build a functioning web app in only 10 kilobytes of javascript, html and css.

I've decided to take an idea I've had kicking around (a trip planner for [weheartplaces](http://www.weheartplaces.com/)) and see if it can be polished up to fit into the 10k limit.

Using the command `ls -l *.css *.js *.html | awk '{sum+=$5} END {print sum}'` to sum up the bytes, I'm already up to 12k of content for the unoptimized code. 

I'm aiming to keep the entire project under 20k in unoptimized form, which will hopefully make the 10k limit achievable. [Coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and [less](http://lesscss.org/) output is quite verbose - and will benefit from [closure](http://code.google.com/closure/) and the [YUI compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/).

Wish me luck. The deadline is lunchtime tomorrow (NZDT).
