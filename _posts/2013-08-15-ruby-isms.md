Here are some ruby things that are really gross and you shouldn't do:

# Unless not nil

I was guilty of this back in the day at [projectx](http://projectx.co.nz/), I used to be editing code and instead of understanding what was going on and fixing it, I'd just insert a not at the start, or an unless, or add .nil? at the end.

    unless not thing.nil?
    
# Mixed hashes

I hate the new ruby json-style hash literals. They're like mega gross. And lots of new rails projects on github use them. I'm sorry I'm so oldschool, and I'm sure I'll eventually come around from my curmudgeonly ways, but if you ever write code like this, you're doing it wrong.

    { key : value, 'other-key' => value }
    
# That you can send(:private_method)

Why is it even private if you can just call it with .send.
