title: Panasonic Lumix and the Optimal Prime
---

I've been waiting to make this post for a few weeks now. I bought a Pansonic Lumix GF1 with the 20mm prime (non-zoomable) lens. It's a real beauty! It takes lovely photos, is a joy to use (nice and fast) and fits in my coat pocket. I bought it as a present to myself for three months working for Lonely Planet in Melbourne.

# Choosing the GF1

I got interested in a camera with a nice prime lens after seeing all [Maddis](http://www.flickr.com/photos/maddiontour) epic photos. He uses a sony Alpha and the minolta beercan lens. I started researching and quickly became interested in getting an [a330](http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/sony_a330_review/) and hunting down some 80s lenses - but as I read around the net about small form factor dslrs, I kept seeing micro four thirds being mentioned, in particular the GF1.

This [review](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicGF1/) at dpreview and [craigmods](http://craigmod.com/journal/gf1-fieldtest/) gf1 review were the articles that really sold me on the GF1. It'll be fun to pack up our house into a big box and then go travel the world with this camera hanging off my neck.
