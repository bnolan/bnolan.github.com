There comes a time in every project - after days of prototyping, design, tweaking, rigorous speccing and bdd, after several deployments to staging and a/b testing with beta users, after polls and roundtables and whiteboarding - that you have to admit that the project isn't any fun to use. 

And that's the opportunity to sit back and reimagine it, then make some small (usually not huge) tweaks until it starts to come together again.
