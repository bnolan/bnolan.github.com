title: Backbone.js Mobile App Retrospective
---

Our [New Zealand camping map](http://rankers.co.nz/) app is finished, has been approved by Apple, and will be released for Android and iPhone in the next few days. I thought I'd take this opportunity to do a retrospective on mobile app development. 

# Overall

My strongest impression from building a pure coffeescript + backbone.js app and then packaging it up in phonegap, was that is Just Worked. I did 90% of my development and graphic design using desktop safari, and only tried it out on mobile devices towards the end of the project.

# Performance
