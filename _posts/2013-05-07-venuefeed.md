title: Aggregator for local restaurants and bars

I stumbled across this idea the other day, when I was wondering what was going on in town, so as you do, I went to the facebook page for hashigo zake, then bebemos, then little beer quarter, then goldings free dive. And I thought, there must be a better way to do this.

So, short of adding every single bar and restaurant in town as a facebook friend, and then having my newsfeed spammed with hundreds of updates, I decided to build a tool that shows updates from all the bars and restaurants in Wellington.

I'm really interested in this idea. The vision I'm working towards would have a filter for bars | cafes | restaurants, the ability to sort by distance or time (so you can see what's been posted nearby you), and a search function so you can look up if anyone is selling _chilli_ or _stout_.

I think this could be a really great tool, and if I can get it working well in Wellington, I'll try get it going in the Mission SF and Melbourne next.
