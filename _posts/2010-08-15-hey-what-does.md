title: Hey what does this button do?
---

I've used photoshop for years and consider myself an intermediate user. You end up using photoshop a lot in webdesign to slice stuff up, or create decent logos - and prior to CSS3 it was my number one gradients tool. However - there's a bunch of stuff photoshop doesn't do. 

With the advent of resolution-independent interfaces (retina display, next version of os x, landscape and portrait views of a site) and the need to create business cards, flyers, stickers and pixel art for websites - I've been learning Adobe Illustrator.

While playing with the [weheartplaces](http://www.weheartplaces.com/) logo - I discovered this menu item:

<cite>Hey - what does this effect do?</cite>

<cite>Houston. We have a logo.</cite>
