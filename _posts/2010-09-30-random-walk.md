title: Random Walk
---

For [twitterplaces](http://twitterplaces.com/), I've been using the Random Walk theory of software development. I pick up the software each day, and work on whatever feature I feel like. There's no plan, no vision, no long term overarching story that directs my work.

I just go to a page that looks scruffier than the rest, then tidy it up. Or play with the data and find another interesting report, then put that in the site somewhere. Occasionally I may have to do a bit of architecture or scaling work, but i don't plan for it - I just do it when required. And I'm always pushing to make the code easily understandable. A random walk doesn't mean spaghetti code. 

It just means, don't beat on feature [a] until it's done. Work on a,b,c and invent feature d. That way you won't wear out and you won't become uninspired.

Sure this won't work for your on-spec, on deadline project, but for your own projects, or experimentation in user interface design, just random walk through your project.

You may be surprised where you end up.
