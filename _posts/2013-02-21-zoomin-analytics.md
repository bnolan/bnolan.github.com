The lifeblood of a website is it's traffic. If no one is using your site, it's basically dead. One of the things that interested me most when I was considering purchasing ZoomIn, was it's traffic stats. On a typical Monday, ZoomIn has around 10,000 visitors, 85% of which are from New Zealand.

This doesn't make ZoomIn a top 100 website in New Zealand in terms of rank, in fact it comes it at number 660 according to the Alexa ranking. That's even further down the list than [Zenbu](http://www.zenbu.co.nz/), a similair site that has been around for about as long.

However, those visitors every day are interested in New Zealand, and are interested in maps, so they're a really great sounding board to try new ideas and try and find one that sticks. Something that I noticed early on (back in 2006) in ZoomIn, was that every time we made a release, we would get a slight bump in traffic. I guess this is because we had interested users, and that whenever they noticed a change to the site, they'd dig around and see what had changed.

I sort of foolishly assumed that I'd get the same little traffic bump every time I do a release to ZoomIn now. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case. I've done about 50 releases to ZoomIn in the past 6 months, many small changes, and a few large ones (redesigning to use twitter bootstrap for example), and none of these releases have made a significant difference to visitors, page views, or pages per visit.

I'm working my way down my list of things to do to ZoomIn, hopefully I can report back in 6 months and show a slow growth in the traffic stats above.
