I've moved out to the east coast of New Zealand to work onsite with a [client](http://rankers.co.nz/). I've been gardening, programming, brainstorming, prototyping, surfing, swimming and mountain biking. It's been a nice time.

I'll probably be in Wellington for the month of July, but apart from that I'm free to move around. If you have any interesting Javascript work on later in the year, I'd be keen to do a 2-3 month stint onsite. Anywhere in the world is fine.
