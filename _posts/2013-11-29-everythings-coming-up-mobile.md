title: "Everythings coming up mobile"

This isn't a particularly controversial position, but I feel that in my own career, now is the time to learn some proper mobile development. I feel that in about two years time, people will do most of their casual browsing on a mobile device, and most of that will be through mobile apps, not through mobile websites.

I think people will still use desktop computers or laptops for their day job, or if they need to do admin work, but I think most casual research and play and surfing will be on mobile apps. I may be wrong, but it just seems like that's the way things are going, I spend more and more of my at-home time playing with apps on my mobile phone instead of using a browser.

So, in case the web has had it's day, I think I'll try my hand at more mobile development, in case that is the way the tide is turning.
