I've been doing some work on getting the private beta of [Weheartplaces](http://weheartplaces.com/) out. I'm using tagging as a way to categorize places, so you can quickly add a place and tag as 'todo', 'cafe' or possibly 'avoid'.

I found [tagbox](http://github.com/rafudu/Tagbox) by Rafudu still works okay with current jquery. It's a bit creaky, but with some CSS tweaks it worked okay out of the box.
