title: We Heart Nokia
---

I'm excited to announce that weheartplaces will be available for Nokia Series 60 phones, as well as the iPhone and Android.

I'll be using the Nokia Webruntime (WRT 1.0), a browser-based environment that effectively allows you to create web/javascript programs that masquerade as normal symbian applications. I've just been testing out the functionality of my [Nokia 6220](http://www.nokia.com.au/find-products/all-phones/nokia-6220-classic?cid=ncomprod-fw-src-na-con-nokia_6220-google-au-20-nokia6220_117), which is a $150 phone with 3G, GPS, driving directions and a 5 megapixel camera.

I'm not sure of the release date yet - but when it's ready it'll be available at my [publishers page](http://store.ovi.com/publisher/Nolan+Consulting/) on the Ovi store.
