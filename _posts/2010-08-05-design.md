While redesigning this blog (I love being able to edit css and template as easily as blog posts, [go github pages](http://pages.github.com/)!), I found myself turning this:

<img src="/images/design-staccato.png" />
<cite>Ordered chronologically</cite>

Into this:

<img src="/images/design-wave.png" />
<cite>Ordered by aesthetic</cite>

I find the wave a lot more pleasing to the eye, and I still kept the primary order mostly intact. This is one of my design tenets - lay out the page by weight and balance, then work out what text you can fit into each of the boxes.

It's almost the opposite of how [the signals](http://37signals.com/papers/introtopatterns//index) do design, but I love it.
