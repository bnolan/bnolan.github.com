I just went on a big skate of melbourne CBD.

I started at home (n√§he Southern Cross Station), then skated out to Prudence in West Melbourne. Prudence is a highly recommended bar. The beer is expensive, but the cocktails apparently are affordable. From Souther Cross to Prudence is mostly uphill, which meant that after a few beers, a few conversations and a good laugh - it was all downhill to Section 8.

Section 8 is a very cool bar. During the day. I went there in the evening and wasn't so impressed. The skate was good though - it's mostly downhill from Prudence along Victoria Street - then turn right, drop down into town (it's a pretty steep skate through traffic down to little collins street) - and a hard left into Section 8.

S8 only had one beer I wanted - and it was in what australians call a "tallie" (800ml beer). I took a few drinks - decided S8 wasn't for me, then stashed the beer in my back pocket and headed through town. There were people everywhere (and you can't drink in public anywhere in Australia) so it took 5/10 minutes before I got out of the city (skating past the Melbourne Cricket Ground by now) and could drink the rest of my beer. It was a lovely long skate past the MCG - down a shallow smooth slope on a path surrounded in trees and grass. Had some good tunes on - nice times.

Then I bombed from the MCG down to Richmond - eyeballed out the gig I was going to go see at the corner bar, decided it wasn't worth $50 to go see - then caught a tram back to Southern Cross and mellowed along Spencer street to home.

Melbourne. Good for skating.
