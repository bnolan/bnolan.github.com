title: Agile board in html5
---

I put [this together](/science/velocity/) as a quick prototype of what an agile board in HTML5 could look like. I'm not a huge agile fan myself, but since I keep having to use pivotal tracker in projects - I'm always tempted to do a little bit more work on it and get it to a usable state.
