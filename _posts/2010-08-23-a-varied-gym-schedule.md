title: A varied gym schedule
---

Like some web developers, I'm a bit ADD, so I find going to the gym a bit of a chore. Don't get me wrong. I love the exercise, the clear headedness afterwards, the more energy you have in every day, the rest for your mind - a blissful 45 minutes where your brain doesn't have to analyse pixels on a screen, or type strange patterns into the keyboard.

But spending 45 minutes with no mental stimulation - how dull is that! Especially when you go to the gym at quiet times (I don't like noisy gyms), there's not even anyone to talk to.

So my workout which is nice and varied is like so:

1. 3km rowing ~12 minutes
1. Situps, pushups and chins x3 sets ~15 minutes
1. Treadmill on hilly mode ~15 minutes

I find the treadmill the hardest, since it's just so dull - but I take it as a nice time to be all Zen (after the half an hour of exercise I find my inner Zen-buddha is easier to access). I set the treadmill to 'randomly changing gradient', so that your heart rate is constantly moving up and down.

Anyway - that works for me, and I've found it an easy workout to do consistently 4 times per week
