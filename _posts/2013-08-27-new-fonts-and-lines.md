title: "New Fonts and Lines"
---
 
It's awesome having a designer sitting downstairs with us. I asked [Kelly](http://twitter.com/kellective) whether my blog still looked okay (since I designed it about 3 years ago). She said that I should get rid of the double lines and change the header fonts. One quick visit to google fonts later, and we're using [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) for headings and all the dotted and doubled lines have been replaced with `1px solid #ccc`.

That's all for the blog post today, bit busy with mobilification of various bits of the Powershop website. But I did do some work on that webRTC social network over the weekend, it kind of came together okay. Then I didn't get anything done on Zoomin on monday, because even though I think it's my best bet as for building something that will actually make an impact (10,000 people visit Zoomin on a monday, I've got a built-in audience), I still don't know what exactly to build to make the social aspect of ZoomIn take off again.

Any ideas for the socialisation of [ZoomIn](http://www.zoomin.co.nz/) are greatly appreciated.
