title: To Market!
---

Are you in Wellington and are serious about starting a tech business? I got an email from the [bright ideas challenge](http://www.brightideaschallenge.co.nz/) with information about the following presentations, from various technical and business development peoples. I'll be attending these three...

## Strategy
Value proposition, business model, pricing model, finances and sustainability - Monday, 30 August 2010. 

## Technical
Intellectual property strategy, legal and governance, prototyping and funding options - Monday, 6 September 2010.

## Go-to-Market
Go-to-market strategy, branding, exporting and distribution - Wednesday, 8 September 2010.

All events are held 4.30-6.30pm in the Memorial Theatre, Victoria University of Wellington. That marketing one sounds especially interesting.
