title: The Art of Happiness

I think this sums it up for me:

<quote>
  When you feel lacking in happiness.
  Don't delay feeling happy 
  for when some future 
  achievement has happened.
  Let yourself feel happy now.
</quote>

[Delayed gratification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_gratification) doesn't apply to happiness.
