I'm really excited about the release of [Facebook Places](http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/403). It's not widely available yet but  it should be rolled out to American Facebook users over the next 24 hours.

The features:

1. Checking in to places, for where you are at the moment
1. Tagging friends as being with you at a place
1. Seeing where your friends are and have been
1. An extensive API for accessing a users places data

It's number 4 that's exciting to me. Facebook gives a bunch of examples of ways the API could be used - including:

_A travel application that gives people the ability to see which of their friends have already been to the place they are visiting._

That's kind of exactly what I've been building. Starting next week, I'll be working on the re-release of [weheartplaces](http://www.weheartplaces.com/), integrated with the Facebook Places api.
