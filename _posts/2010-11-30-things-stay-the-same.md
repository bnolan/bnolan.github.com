title: On how things stay the same

When you're young and you have problems or obstacles, you are comforted by the fact that you'll get through this and in the future you won't have such problems.

It's interesting how no water how as you get older and more experienced, you get much better at solving your problems (oh it's a X so i'll do a Y), but that feeling of 'my god, what the fuck am i going to do' doesn't go away. It just is more brief before you accept 'oh well, i'll just have to use a self tapping bit and use an oversized thread.

Well, that's how it's been so far - be interesting to see what the next 20 years of problem solving will reveal.
