title: Be careful cycling
---

I bought a nice road bike, a Giant OCR2, for my daily commute from Petone to Wellington. I don't bike on rainy days though, busses on those days.

I learnt my lesson about not going too fast along the waterfront yesterday. A lady cyclist popped out of nowhere and I jumped on the anchors but still slammed into her hard enough to bend my shifters. So now I have gammy shifters that won't change up properly, and I need to remove the hoods and straighten the shifters out so that they face forwards again. To be honest it was a bit of a lucky save, I'm 110kg, so if I'd hit an old lady or someone with a pram, it could've been a way worse situation. So lessson learnt, hold fire on full-power until I get onto Thorndon Quay, or even better, the old hutt road where there is less traffic and I can really unleash.

Apologies to the lady that I busted into, I'm glad you weren't hurt stranger lady.
