title: Diaspora-x ui work

I've been doing some work on buddycloud / diaspora-x user interface. Screenshots follow:

I have to admit that the buddycloud ui looks a lot nicer, with blues and colors, but I'll be sticking with the grey and black ui that diaspora-x features.

I'm getting ready to deploy the latest diaspora-x.
