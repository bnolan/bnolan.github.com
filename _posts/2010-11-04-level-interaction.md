I've just posted a [new video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWzGjUiL4LY) of Hutch. New features include terrain generation, better collision detection, item interaction, tile interaction. I've been looking around the web and also found a few people doing truly amazing javascript stuff:

* [Rumpetroll](http://rumpetroll.com/)
* [Rocketpack](http://rocketpack.fi/)

It really looks like Javascript gaming is about to take off!
