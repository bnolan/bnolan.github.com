title: Attacked by wheelchair!
---

Bwahahaha [the bbc](http://bit.ly/f9SzAH). The world media is really doing a great job of acting like fucks at the moment. My favourite quotes from this video: "There are allegations you were rolling your wheelchair towards the police" and (to the cerebal palsy sufferer) "There were people throwing chunks of concrete at the police. Were you throwing things at the police".

Those riot police do earn their money though. Just imagine standing there, in the open, having a guy in a wheelchair rolling towards you.

Fucking terrifying.

To be honest, the police did have riot gear to protect themselves.

And there were hundreds of them.

But the dude had a FUCKING WHEELCHAIR!

Those wheelchairs are pretty much a deadly weapon.
