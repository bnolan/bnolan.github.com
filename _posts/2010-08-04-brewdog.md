title: Brewdog Punk IPA

I just discovered the awe inspiring [flagstaff cellars](http://apps.facebook.com/weheartplaces/cities/1004679663-wellington/places/935148610-flagstaff_cellars), which is a tucked away little beershop in an unassuming corner of Melbourne.

The thing about this place though, is that is a stocker of Brewdog, Rogue, Epic and a number of good Australian beers - such as Matilda Alpha, Little Creatures and Moo Brew.

Anyway - they had this beer on special - [Punk IPA](http://www.brewdog.com/punk_ipa.php) by [Brewdog](http://www.brewdog.com/), so I bought two and came home and tried them.

The internet website [rate beer](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/brewdog-punk-ipa/72423/) said good things about the Punk IPA, although the haters at [beer advocate](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16315/39435) weren't so enamoured. The guy who drunk a Punk IPA that was 12 months past it's best date - in particular - has a bad time with the beer.

# My review of Punk IPA

This beer is awesome. It cost $5. I will drink it again. Probably in a few minutes when I get the other one out of the fridge. <b>5 stars.</b>
