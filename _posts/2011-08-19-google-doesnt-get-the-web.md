title: Google doesn't get the web
---

It must drive the google search team crazy, when they look at the sort of html the rest of the google organisation spits out. Take for example - this [google places](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=3923961084232206133) page. There is no html, no metadata, no microformats, no schema.org support. It's basically impossible to index. How can they run the worlds biggest web crawler, but generate such obtuse and impossible to index code themselves? It's astounding I say!
