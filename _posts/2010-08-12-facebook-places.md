This [analysis by Gigom](http://gigaom.com/2010/08/10/facebook-places-will-be-about-more-than-just-a-check-in/) is interesting to me. I'm really keen to see what Facebook does with places. What they've done so far has been underwhelming technically, but has seen impressive takeup.

For example - try searching for [Hashigo Zake](http://apps.facebook.com/weheartplaces/places/935148524-hashigo_zake) (a Wellington beer bar popular with early adopters / geeks) on various services:

  * [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wellington-New-Zealand/Hashigo-Zake/144268315585) - 413 people, 100s of posts  * [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/venue/306746) - 65 people, 3 tips
  * [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com/spots/571126) - 10 people, 4 comments
  * [Google places](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=11598129844502475571&q=hashigo+zake&hl=en&cd=1&ei=BSBiTLDxDYOEvgPfzKSqDg&sig2=RxTDHaj8pywo70MGfMzcSg&dtab=2&pcsi=11598129844502475571,1&geocode=FX7wif0douxqCg&sll=-41.291693,174.779499&sspn=0.004184,0.003358&ie=UTF8&ll=-41.289126,174.777267&spn=0,0&z=17&iwloc=A) (complete with shitty url) - 5 peoples maps - 2 reviews
  * [Twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=hashigo+zake) - 4 tweets in the past week

Facebook has such massive uptake, that whatever it does has an impact. The understanding, technology and devices behind 'location based' services are so widespread that it's really a case of Facebook just providing the tools and they'll probably dominate existing location based services.

I hope that the Facebook place APIs are interesting - because I'm totally jumping on that bandwagon from day 1 - the [@majicdave](http://twitter.com/majicdave) school of business.
