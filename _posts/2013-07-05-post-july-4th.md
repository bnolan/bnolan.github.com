This is a pretty epic post to send. With koz and sam on my mind. (Good to count you as a friend koz, even if I don't follow you on twitter).

It'd be cool if there was a service that records all the keys you type.

Because I've typed a whole bunch of keys tonight. And deleted a few.

Sam. You're a good friend.

(I've hit 'rewind' 5 times in this post/email)

Okay. So I'm sitting in my kitchen and writing this post.

I'd like to delete everything I posted, and rewrite this from scratch.

And there's a good chance I'll type command-a and press space.

It'd be weird to create a blog posting service where you could only type keys, and every time you typed backspace, it recorded it as ^D, and you couldn't press shift-left-key.
