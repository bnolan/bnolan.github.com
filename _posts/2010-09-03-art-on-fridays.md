title: Specialization and Art
---

I like [Heinleins quote](http://elise.com/quotes/a/heinlein_-_specialization_is_for_insects.php), so instead of Follow Friday, I decided to try and post Art on Friday. So, an old charcoal drawing that's been hanging in my office, and 90 seconds of my acoustic guitar.

A warning - I made the guitar track up as I went along, so it's pretty rough eh.

The track was recorded by the imac's internal microphone (I need to get a 9 volt battery so I can use the pick-ups on the acoustic), so sounds a bit like it was recorded in a tin can.
