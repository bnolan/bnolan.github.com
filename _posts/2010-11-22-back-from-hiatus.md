Sorry I've neglected my blog for two weeks. I was finishing up a contract, and then took a week break to work on some personal projects, as well as sort out various life things.

# Travelling around New Zealand

In February, my girlfriend and I are travelling around New Zealand for 2 months, before heading off to Brisbane, then various other destinations around the world. To get the most out of our trip, we've been planning a bunch of places to go on weheartplaces. It's still early days - but if you go to my [guides page](http://www.weheartplaces.com/users/110237153/guides) you can see pictures and addresses for some of the campgrounds, breweries and beaches we want to visit while we're travelling around.

The DOC (Department of Conservation) campsites are the best, since they cost only $6-$10 a night, and tend to be in more remote areas. 

I had an interesting talk with some New Zealand based travel guys about making their campsite data accessible offline, so if that comes up, Rissa and I should be able to travel around with a full database of every nice freedom or DOC campsite available.

# My favourite places in the world.

I made a quick list of my [Favourite places in the world](http://www.weheartplaces.com/users/110237153/guides/5):

[Midnight Espresso](http://www.weheartplaces.com/users/110237153/bookmarks/702622926), [Hofbra√ºkeller](http://www.weheartplaces.com/users/110237153/bookmarks/702622967), [Cathedral Cove](http://www.weheartplaces.com/users/110237153/bookmarks/702622968), and [Ferchensee](http://www.weheartplaces.com/users/110237153/bookmarks/702622969).

# Nokia 5230

I bought another new Nokia, this time a Nokia 5230, which has the more modern Web Runtime 7.2, so that I can build some backbone.js applications that run on IOS, Android or Nokia.

Compared to some of my other projects, which are pure ruby on rails, no javascript at all - my Phonegap / Web Runtime apps have a gnarly technology stack:

* Coffeescript
* Backbone.js
* Jquery mobile
* Less CSS
* Qunit
* Phonegap

I'll talk more about phonegap and backbone.js + jquery mobile later this week.
