title: Silverstripe hosting

I have a little joke going that I think a hosted [silverstripe](http://silverstripe.com/) would be quite a good competitor to wordpress.

Silverstripe is an excellent CMS built by some of my friends in Wellington. They have a big company now, over 30 people, lots of big clients - and they even have a product - [Dawn](http://silverstripe.com/dawn/). Wordpress.com is the free hosting provider that runs [Wordpress MU](http://mu.wordpress.org/) and has approximately a [bajillion](http://ma.tt/2010/09/msn-spaces-closing-becomes-wp-com/#comments) blogs on it.

The revenue stream is that on wp.com, you have to pay to get [premium features](http://en.wordpress.com/products/), like CSS editing, premium themes, custom domain names. I think it's an awesome business model that the Silverstripe team should take a look at.
