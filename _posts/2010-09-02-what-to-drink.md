title: What to drink on Thursdays?
---

I've been making a real effort to avoid coffee in the afternoon. I've made the discovery that although the first cup of coffee in the morning is awesome, afternoon coffees are just that 'cup of stress' that my vegan friends talk about.

So I made myself a handy guide to what I should drink, hour by hour, on Thurdays.

The beer is optional, although I was planning on catching up with [Herr Schommer](http://chillu.com/) after work.
