I've got two apps on the go using Phonegap, and this is just a quick post to say that I can highly recommend the mobile web as a development platform. My list of tools / libraries that I use:

* Capt for building the project and compiling / watching intermediate languages
* LESS.js for css
* Coffeescript
* Backbone.js
* Underscore.js
* My responsive map/reduce underscore.js helpers (yet to be released)
* Leaflet for touch-based maps that are GPU accelerated
* JSON.js from douglas crockford
* jQuery, although I may move to using zepto later on
* Phonegap for deploying to Android and iPhone
* Makefile for packaging and bundling
* Jasmine for speccing
* Latlon.js for distance and bearing functions
* iScroll.js for fixed position headers and footers
* Cross-origin ajax requests to allow local development while accessing remote servers
* ECO templates by Sam Stephenson for in-app rendering
* JST templates from underscore.js for static html

It's a pretty nice toolkit. I need to do some more work on capt and put up a sample app so that other people can use my toolkit, but yeah, coffeescript, backbone and less.js are a great way to build mobile apps.
