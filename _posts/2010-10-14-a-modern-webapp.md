title: A modern webapp
---

Want to write a modern webapp using lots of javascript? Here's my recommended toolkit:

* [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) for brevity
* [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) for sanity
* [Jquery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) (with [Aristo](http://taitems.tumblr.com/post/482577430/introducing-aristo-a-jquery-ui-theme)) for your design and widgets
* [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) for your views (see \_.template)
* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) for your models andd controllerts
* [Jammit](http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/) for asset packaging
  
I've only recently discovered backbone and jammit, but I have a lot of respect for [Jeremy](http://github.com/jashkenas/) so they're my [bet](http://weheartplaces.com/).
