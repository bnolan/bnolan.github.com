title: Smallest turing complete language
---

I was wondering what the smallest set of opcodes would be for a turing complete language.

[Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) seems to indicate that you need 8 opcodes:

 * Move the data pointer left or right
 * Increment / decrement the data pointer
 * Write the data pointer to the output
 * Read input to the data pointer
 * Loop until the data pointer is zero
