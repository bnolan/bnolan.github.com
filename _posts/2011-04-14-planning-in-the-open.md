I've been designing today. The current [Buddycloud](http://buddycloud.com/) site needs a refresh - so I busted out Jekyll (the tool I use to generate bennolan.com), some css3 and the blueprint css framework.

<cite>The in development buddycloud site</cite>

It came together quite nicely, and because we're hosting the repository for the site on github - you too can go [visit the site](http://buddycloud.github.com/) - even though it's unfinished.

Which brings a dilemma. Do we make the repository private - remove the hosted instance and only require people working with Buddycloud to view the in-development site? There's sure some interesting / awkward stuff in there - a lot of lorem ipsum text and some rough guesses of price points and a business model.

Well - to be honest, what kills most small businesses (which is what Buddycloud is at the moment) is obscurity or apathy, not giving interested parties too much insight into your business. So we'll leave it up for now, and then everyone can see the site when it's ready for 'public' deployment.
