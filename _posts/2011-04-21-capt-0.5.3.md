title: Capt 0.5.3
---

I've just pushed [capt](/capt/) 0.5.3. Code generation works properly now `generate controller` and `generate model`, and the capt watch and capt server commands actually work (I was a bit premature announcing on Tuesday). I'm using this on two projects now and it has been a really nice toolchain. 

Autogeneration of spec classes is good for maintainability too. I kinda wish I had been BDD-ing [Buddycloud](https://github.com/buddycloud/channel-webclient) at the moment. That's some complicated stuff.
